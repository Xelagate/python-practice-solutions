# Python Practice

This repository contains various Python problems that I have solved as part of my learning journey. Each problem is designed to improve my coding skills and understanding of Python.

## Solved Problems

1. **Lost Sequence** - A simple program that prints a sequence of numbers that were famously used in a TV series and believed to bring luck.
   - **Code:** [main.py](main.py)
   - **Description:** This task required printing the sequence "4 8 15 16 23 42" with a space between each number. The challenge was to use the `print()` function to output each number as a separate argument, ensuring that they are separated by spaces.
   - **Sample Output:**
     ```
     4 8 15 16 23 42
     ```
